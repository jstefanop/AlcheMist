# AlcheMist


This is the Python driver for the Alchemist Scrypt Alcheminer ASIC. This code has been updated and modified heavily by the community from the stock firmware, and provides much better stratum stability, updates to the web UI, and options for over/underclocking.

Code is maintained by jstefanop (jstefanop at mac.com)

#Clock Speed
The driver is currently configured to run at 320mhz (which provides the highest MH/watt performance), and is recommended, as the cooling system for the boards is inadiquate for anything higher and will cause high amount of rejects. 

If you wish to change the clock speed there are 3 other options in the asic_miner.py file (support for more options and command line/GUI option to change clock will be added soon).

The options are commented by the values below, there are 5 places in the code you need to change to switch the clock speed, just comment the current speed block and uncomment the desired frequency
```
#288 Mhz underclock
#320 Mhz underclock  <---Driver curreently set to this
#352 Mhz Stock Clock <--not recommended
# 384 Mhz Overclock  <--not recommended
```

This firmware uses updated twisted libraries on the unbuntu controller instructions to update below (not required but recommended):

Download twisted 12.2.0 source from this site:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted/12.2.0

download it to home as a binary not text

untar as follwing from
https://docs.python.org/2/install/#building-extensions-tips-and-tricks
```
tar jxf  Twisted-12.2.0.tar
cd Twisted-12.2.0
```

Install these two packages:
```
python-dev
build-essential
```

Then compile (in Twisted-12.2.0)
```
sudo python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
```

Renamed twisted in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ to twisted.old 
```
-cd /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages 
-mv twisted twisted.old
```
create symbolic link to new tws
```
ln Â–s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Twisted-12.2.0-py2.7-linux-armv7l.egg/twisted/ twisted
cd into the new twisted link and make sure files are there.
```
then restart

to verify do these commands
```
python
import twisted
print twisted.version
exit()
```

it should say 12.2.0
