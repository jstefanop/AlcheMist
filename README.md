# AlcheMist


This is the Python driver modified to run on a raspberry pi, and can control an individual Alcheminer blade using the UART pins on the pi (or more if you use USB->UART dongles).

#Install

Follow these instructions to get your pi ready to run the driver

Update your pi

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install python-dev and build essentials

```
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Install twisted

```
wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/T/Twisted/Twisted-12.2.0.tar.bz2#md5=9a321b904d01efd695079f8484b37861
tar jxf Twisted-12.2.0.tar.bz2 
sudo python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
```

Install autobahn (need pip to do this)

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install autobahn[twisted]
```

We now need to free up the serial port on the pi that is being used for console output, to do this download this scrypt, run it and reboot

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lurch/rpi-serial-console/master/rpi-serial-console -O /usr/bin/rpi-serial-console && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-serial-console
sudo rpi-serial-console disable
sudo reboot
```

cd to home directory and install this repo

```
git clone -b AlcheMist_raspi https://github.com/jstefanop/AlcheMist.git
```

#Clock Speed
The driver is currently configured to run at 320mhz (which provides the highest MH/watt performance), and is recommended, as the cooling system for the boards is inadiquate for anything higher and will cause high amount of rejects. 

If you wish to change the clock speed there are 3 other options in the asic_miner.py file (support for more options and command line/GUI option to change clock will be added soon).

The options are commented by the values below, there are 5 places in the code you need to change to switch the clock speed, just comment the current speed block and uncomment the desired frequency
```
#288 Mhz underclock
#320 Mhz underclock  <---Driver curreently set to this
#352 Mhz Stock Clock <--not recommended
# 384 Mhz Overclock  <--not recommended
```

---
This firmware uses updated twisted libraries on the unbuntu controller instructions to update below (not required but recommended):

Download twisted 12.2.0 source from this site:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted/12.2.0

download it to home as a binary not text

untar as follwing from
https://docs.python.org/2/install/#building-extensions-tips-and-tricks
```
tar jxf  Twisted-12.2.0.tar
cd Twisted-12.2.0
```

Install these two packages:
```
python-dev
build-essential
```

Then compile (in Twisted-12.2.0)
```
sudo python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
```

Renamed twisted in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ to twisted.old 
```
-cd /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages 
-mv twisted twisted.old
```
create symbolic link to new tws
```
ln Â–s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Twisted-12.2.0-py2.7-linux-armv7l.egg/twisted/ twisted
cd into the new twisted link and make sure files are there.
```
then restart

to verify do these commands
```
python
import twisted
print twisted.version
exit()
```

it should say 12.2.0
